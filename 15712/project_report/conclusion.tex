\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we investigated the use of indirection in hybrid switch scheduling problem. We formulated the scheduling problem into an integer linear programming problem and solved the problem with and without the use of indirecton. The optimal solution given by ILP shows that indirection can successfully reduce configuration times and increase the demand served by hybrid swithch in a skewed traffic pattern. The ILP optimal solution shows the potential benefits of using the indirection scheduling algorithm. To prove the practical benefit of indirection, we designed and implemented an indirection scheduling algorithm based on simple heuristics. Experiment results show that even an algorithm based on very simple heuristics can achievie reasonable improvements over the direct-path algorithm.
